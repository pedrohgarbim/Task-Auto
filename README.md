# ðŸ›’ GB Wear Automation Script

A simple and practical Python automation script using `pyautogui` that simulates the complete flow of a user visiting the [GB Wear](https://www.gbwear.com.br) website. It closes the initial popup, navigates through the menu, selects a kimono, picks size `A1`, and adds it to the cart â€” all automatically.
